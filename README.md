Congratulations on your progress so far in this course! Hopefully you are
feeling proud of and excited about your new skills. Now, on to the next
challenge!  As you may have picked up, a core piece of our teaching philosophy
at Flatiron School is “you can’t learn real skills without real tools.” Want
some good news? We think you’re ready to take your coding to the next level and
start using the tools and workflows that REAL, professional developers use.
Let’s go!

## Looking Ahead: The Learn IDE

In the next step, you’ll gain access to a tool that we call the Learn IDE, or
"Integrated Development Environment." We promise, getting it setup is simple.
It's worth taking a moment to breathe a deep breath before you encounter the
IDE.
